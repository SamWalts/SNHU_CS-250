# SNHU_CS-250
Final project for SNHU portfolio
# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How did "user stories" help with that?
By making the requirements in the form of user stories, we can see how our work will effect the end user. I used the information provided during the slide shows and prompts to craft stories that will fulfil the product requirements. 
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
From working on this class, I really came to realize that coding is only a small part of any software written. Doing the research and making sure that you are getting the requirements correct saves so much more time than just coding coding coding.
I do love coding, but I am also realizing that there are a lot more jobs in software development than just writing code, and that they are all crucial to the development of good software.
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member means to communicate, and be respectful. We are there to work together, not against each other, and the key to that is communication. If a team does nothing else in Scrum, then the daily standup will help improve effeciency.
That is something that I think is missing with going to an online school is having that collaboration from talking to your teammates and fellow students every day.
